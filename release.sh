# Release Script -- Test, bump, tag, publish to npm, create GitHub release
# =============================================================================
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh <new-version>    -- local mode, e.g. ./release.sh 0.9.1
#   ./release.sh                  -- CI mode (version derived from git tag)
#
# Local mode: runs from your workstation, bumps + commits + tags + pushes.
# CI mode: invoked by .github/workflows/release.yml on tag push, skips the
# bump/commit/tag/push steps (already done) and publishes with --provenance
# using NODE_AUTH_TOKEN from GitHub Actions secrets.
# If interrupted, just re-run with the same version -- each step is idempotent.
#
# Prerequisites (local):
#   - gh CLI authenticated
#   - npm automation token in ~/.npmrc (npmjs.com -> Access Tokens -> Generate
#     -> Automation). Do NOT use `npm login --auth-type=web` -- it OVERWRITES
#     that automation token with a 2FA-bound web session, and the next publish
#     then EOTPs on a WebAuthn challenge.
#   - clean git working tree on main, up to date with origin/main
# Prerequisites (CI): NODE_AUTH_TOKEN env, GITHUB_TOKEN env, CI=true.

# --- CHANGELOG promotion (ported from aws-mcp, originally ctxlint) ----------
# This script had no changelog handling at all: it never promoted the
# [Unreleased] heading, so documented work accumulated there while the
# versions that shipped it went out with no entry (0.14.0 through 0.16.0,
# backfilled on 2026-09-14), and step 6 took the GitHub release notes from
# commit subjects regardless of what CHANGELOG.md said.
#
# Every release now gets a `## [<version>]` entry, and step 6 sources the
# release notes from it:
#   * [Unreleased] has content -> it becomes the version section, and a fresh,
#     empty [Unreleased] heading is left above it for the next change.
#   * [Unreleased] is empty or absent -> a version section is generated from
#     the commit subjects since the previous tag. Raw subjects are less than a
#     hand-written entry, but a version with no entry at all reads as a mistake.
#   * The Keep-a-Changelog link references at the bottom, when the file has
#     them, are moved along: [Unreleased] compares from the new tag, and the
#     version gets its own compare link.

# SKIP_LINT=1 escape hatch -- wraps `npm`/`pnpm` so lint-related runs are
# no-ops.
#
# THIS SHOULD NOW BE UNNECESSARY, and reaching for it is a signal something
# regressed. `npm run lint` routes through scripts/lint.mjs, which runs biome
# from a binary that works on this host: on Windows ARM64 it provisions the x64
# build of the SAME version package-lock.json installs and runs that under
# emulation.
#
# The earlier text here blamed "the MINGW64-ARM64 npm-run-script wrapper" and
# justified skipping with "CI catches lint regressions anyway". Both were wrong.
# `npm run` is fine on that host (a plain node script through the same wrapper
# exits 0); the SIGSEGV comes from the arm64 biome executable itself
# (`@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64/biome.exe`), reproduced in @yawlabs/aws-mcp by
# invoking that binary directly with no npm in the picture. Nor is it a
# permanent arm64 defect: measured on this host, arm64 biome 2.5.4 exits 139,
# while 2.4.16 and 2.5.13 check a tree and report normally. The wrapper routes
# around the arm64 build regardless of version so that a later bump landing on
# a bad one cannot turn this gate into a crash mid-release.
#
# And there is no CI to fall back on: this repo has no .github/workflows
# directory and GitHub Actions is disabled on it, so nothing downstream
# re-checks formatting -- skipping the lint step means the release is published
# unlinted, full stop.
#
# So: only set SKIP_LINT=1 if scripts/lint.mjs cannot produce a result at all,
# and treat that as a bug to fix rather than a step to routinely skip.

# --- npm propagation gate (part of step 7, deliberately not a step of its own) ---
#
# `npm publish` returns as soon as the registry ACCEPTS the tarball, but the
# version is not immediately readable from the CDN-backed read path. The MCP
# Registry validates by READING the package, so a registry publish that runs
# straight after `npm publish` can fail with "version 'X' was not found
# (status: 404)". ssh-mcp v0.15.3 failed exactly that way, and aws-mcp did on
# three consecutive releases (2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2). Each recovered only by
# waiting and re-running, i.e. the release cost two invocations and a human
# in the loop.
#
# Polling here makes one invocation enough (ported from aws-mcp's release.sh).
# Three deliberate choices:
#
#   * curl, not `npm view`. npm caches registry metadata (5 min by default), so
#     a poll through it can keep reporting the pre-publish answer well after the
#     version is live -- the loop would then outlast the condition it is waiting
#     on.
#   * The EXACT URL the MCP Registry fetches. Its npm validator requests
#     <base>/url.PathEscape(name)/<version>, and Go's PathEscape turns the scope
#     slash into %2F (`@yawlabs%2Fpkg`, the `@` left bare). A literal-slash URL
#     reaches the same origin but can be a different CDN cache entry, so success
#     there would be a proxy rather than evidence about the path that fails.
#   * WARN, never fail, on timeout. If propagation is genuinely stuck, letting
#     mcp-publisher run produces its own precise error naming the version and
#     status; a timeout message from this loop would replace that with something
#     strictly less informative. This gate can only make the release faster,
#     never worse than it was before it existed.
